For this reason, you have the option to increase the `conv_stride` from $1$ to $2$ or even larger - this may decrease the efficacy of the convolutional layer but will at the same time significantly decrease the amount of computation required (indeed the computation decreases *quadratically* with this parameter), yet you should still be able to make significant improvement over the previous network.\n",
